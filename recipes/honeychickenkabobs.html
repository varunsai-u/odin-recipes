    <img src="../images/honeychickenkabobs.png" alt="image of honey chicken kabobs">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chicken kabobs are marinated in a sweet and savory soy sauce and honey mixture that doubles as a basting sauce as the kabobs cook on the grill, adding delicious flavor to every bite of juicy chicken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Chicken:</strong>Cut boneless, skinless chicken breast halves into 1-inch cubes.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Onion:</strong> You can use any onion variety you want — red, white, or sweet — depending on your flavor preferences. Cut the onion into 2-inch pieces.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Bell peppers:</strong>This recipe calls for two red bell peppers cut into 2-inch pieces. You can also use yellow or green peppers.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Garlic:</strong>You'll add two cloves of fresh garlic to the marinade with the other ingredients.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Skewers:</strong>You can usually find bamboo skewers in the grilling aisle at your grocery store.</p></li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the marinade</h3>
            <p>Whisk together the honey, soy sauce, oil, and black pepper in a large bowl. Transfer ¼-cup of the marinade to a small jar and seal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Marinate the ingredients</h3>
            <p>Add the chicken, onions, peppers, and garlic to the marinade in the bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours, but preferably overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Assemble the kabobs</h3>
            <p>Drain the chicken and vegetables, then discard the marinade. Thread the ingredients onto the skewers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Grill the kabobs</h3>
            <p>Grill the skewers on a lightly oiled, preheated grate. Cook, turning frequently and brushing with reserved marinade, until the chicken is fully cooked and no longer pink in the center.</p>
